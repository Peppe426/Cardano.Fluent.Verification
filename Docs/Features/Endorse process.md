# The endorse process
The endorse process, involves attaching funds to a package of information that has a truth value. This creates a system where one can see who is vouching for the information and if there is money behind it. 
The idea is that if the information is proven to be false, the money behind it is lost. This could make the information more trustworthy than information that no one is willing to back financially. 
Drawing on this concept, it's suggested that journalists or news organizations could be held to a similar standard, where they must put money behind a story they publish. If the story turns out to be misleading, untrue, or propaganda, the bond is called, and they lose the money.

This concept is considered foundational for next-generation social networks and enhances the power of verification. 
By including the DID (Decentralized Identifier) standard, could help to solve problems like bot accounts and impersonation, as it would lead to verified communications. Furthermore, this concept could be extended to include the creation of an Origin NFT (Non-Fungible Token) whenever content is created, which would include metadata such as the date and story of creation
