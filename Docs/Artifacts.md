## A Decentralized Identifier (DID)

A Decentralized Identifier (DID) is a type of identifier that is globally unique, resolvable with high availability, and cryptographically verifiable. DIDs are typically associated with decentralized blockchain networks, where they are used to enable a self-sovereign identity that the user controls, rather than a centralized authority.

DIDs work by providing an abstract identifier that can be resolved to a DID document. This document contains information about how to use the DID, including public keys and service endpoints associated with the DID subject. Importantly, DIDs are designed to be decoupled from the underlying systems that store and communicate data about the subject, thus allowing for interoperability across different domains and systems.
