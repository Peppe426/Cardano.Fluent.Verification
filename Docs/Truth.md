## Three truths 
The "three truths" as described by Neil Degrasse Tyson are concepts that classify truth into distinct categories based on their nature and acceptance:

### Objective Truth: 
Objective Truth is something that is true regardless of belief. It can be established through scientific methods and is verifiable by others through research, making it universally accepted and provable through evidence.

### Personal Truth: 
Personal Truth refers to truths that are individual and often tied to one's beliefs and values, such as religious beliefs. These truths are critical to individuals but cannot be imposed on others, as they are subjective and may not be held by all.

### Political Truth: 
Political Truth is often deemed true because of its repetitive assertion rather than based on objective evidence. It commonly appears in political discourse, swaying public opinion, and can be influenced by propaganda, media bias, and political agendas, and thus, may be subjective and not necessarily based on fact

***The goal is to define something as an objective truth in a decentralized verification system.***

#### Defining Bounds:
**Clear Criteria:** Clearly define the criteria that delineate the bounds of what can be considered an objective truth within the system. This might relate to the types of evidence required, the methods by which data is gathered, and the standards that must be met.
**Evidence Collection:** Develop a standardized protocol for collecting, submitting, and evaluating evidence. This protocol should rely on objective, quantifiable measures to ensure that the bounds of the truth are maintained.
**Automated Verification:** Utilize smart contracts or other automated processes that can enforce the bounds without human bias, and that can objectively validate if the submitted evidence meets the predefined criteria.

#### Vouching System:
**Reputation Mechanism:** Implement a reputation system where entities that have been consistently reliable can vouch for the veracity of evidence.
**Staking:** Include a staking mechanism where entities vouching for a truth must stake a certain amount of cryptocurrency or tokens. If the evidence they vouch for is later proven false, they would lose their stake, creating a financial incentive for truthfulness.
**Network of Validators:** Create a decentralized network of validators whose job is to verify the evidence. Validators could vouch for the truth of the evidence based on rigorous checking against the predefined bounds.

#### Conflict Resolution:
**Challenge System:** Allow for a challenge system where claimed truths can be disputed. If a piece of evidence is contested, it would undergo a secondary, more thorough review process.
**Decentralized Jurisdiction:** Establish a decentralized arbitration process to resolve conflicts when the bounds of truth or the validity of a vouch are in question. This would involve a fair and transparent process managed by the community or selected jurors.

#### Transparency and Audit Trails:
**Immutable Logging:** Use an immutable ledger to record all submissions, evidence, vouches, and decisions. This creates an auditable trail that supports transparency and accountability.
**Open Access to Data:** Ensure that the evidence and the basis for the verification are accessible for public scrutiny, which reinforces the credibility of the objective truth.

##### TODOS
**Establish Criteria:** Define clear, quantifiable criteria for what can be accepted as objective truth within the system.
**Evidence Submission:** Develop a standardized process for submitting evidence that must adhere to the established criteria.
**Automated Verification:** Use automated mechanisms, like smart contracts, to verify the evidence against the criteria without human bias.
**Vouching:** Implement a reputation and staking system where trusted entities can vouch for the truth of the evidence, potentially risking something of value if the evidence is false.
**Validator Network:** Have a decentralized network of validators who independently verify the evidence and can vouch for its validity based on the system's bounds.
**Challenge and Review:** Allow for the proposed truth to be challenged and subjected to an additional review process if needed.
**Decentralized Arbitration:** In case of disputes, utilize a fair and transparent decentralized arbitration process.
**Immutable Record Keeping:** Log submissions, evidence, and decisions in an immutable ledger for transparency and accountability.
**Public Scrutiny:** Make evidence and verification decisions open for public review to reinforce the established truths' credibility.
