## Feature: Broadcast Authenticator
Each scenario describes a specific function of the Broadcast Authenticator, including generating and checking signatures to verify post authenticity, preventing impersonation, and improving trust metrics for content. The actors involved in these scenarios primarily include content creators and the Broadcast Authenticator itself, with interactions implicitly including other system components like DIDs and trust metric systems.

### Scenario: Creating and signing a new post by a user
**Given** a content creator has drafted a new social media post
**When** they submit the post for broadcasting
**Then** the Broadcast Authenticator generates a cryptographic signature based on the creator's DID
And attaches the signature to the post to attest to its origin
And the post is published with a trust metric indicating its verified status

### Scenario: Validating a post against the creator's identity
**Given** a post is submitted for broadcast on the social media platform
**When** the Broadcast Authenticator reviews the post
**Then** it validates the identity of the creator against the posted content using their DID
If the identity matches the creator, the post is confirmed as authentic
Otherwise, the post is flagged for potential impersonation or fake news

### Scenario: Preventing impersonation of a high-profile individual
**Given** a social media post claims to be from a high-profile individual
**When** the Broadcast Authenticator checks the cryptographic signature
**Then** it verifies the signature against the high-profile individual's registered DID
If the signature does not match, the post is denied broadcasting and flagged as impersonation
And the platform takes appropriate action to notify users and the impersonated party

### Scenario: Improving trust metrics for content sourced from verified individuals 
**Given** multiple posts from various creators are submitted for broadcast
**When** the Broadcast Authenticator processes these posts
**Then** it assigns a higher trust metric to content from verified sources
And it promotes the visibility of posts from these trusted creators on the social media platform
Ensuring that trustworthy content is prioritized and easily identifiable by users
