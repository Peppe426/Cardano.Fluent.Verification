## Feature: __Decentralized Verification of Objective Truth__
These scenarios address the bounds and criteria for establishing objective truths; and they incorporate the endorse process where financial stakes are associated with the truth value of information.

### Scenario: A journalist endorsing a news story
**Given** An objective truth is required to publish a news article
And A journalist has a piece of evidence for a story
**When** The journalist stakes funds to endorse the truth value of the evidence
**Then** The evidence is submitted to a decentralized network of validators
And The validators verify the evidence against predefined criteria using automated verification processes
And If the evidence meets the criteria, the story is published
If the evidence is proven false, the journalist's bond is called and they lose the money

### Scenario: A community member challenging the validity of a published story
**Given** An objective truth has been claimed in a published news article
And A community member doubts the validity of the evidence
**When** The community member initiates a challenge system
**Then** The claim undergoes a secondary, more thorough review process by a decentralized network of expert validators
And If the evidence is found not to meet the objective truth criteria, the endorsers lose their stake

### Scenario: Independent auditing of published evidence
**Given** Evidence for a published news story is available on an immutable ledger
**When** An independent auditor wants to verify the veracity of the evidence
**Then** The auditor accesses the open data and the basis for the verification
And Validates the evidence using the public record
And Enhances the transparency and credibility of the published story

### Scenario: Decentralized arbitration in case of a disputed truth claim
**Given** A truth claim in a published article is disputed
And The validators cannot reach a consensus about the claim's validity
**When** A decentralized jurisdiction process is initiated
**Then** Selected community jurors deliberate and vote on the evidence's conformity to the objective truth
And The result of their decision is logged on an immutable ledger
And Stakes are settled in accordance with the decision to maintain system integrity
