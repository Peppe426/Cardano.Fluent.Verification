## Feature: Key Protection Service
These scenarios provide a framework for how the Key Protection Service might manage the storage and access of private keys, ensuring that keys are both protected and available to authorized individuals when needed. The scenarios include interactions with users for key generation, content signing, key revocation and re-issuance, as well as authority verification for official communications.

### Scenario: Storing a new user's private keys securely
**Given** a user has completed the registration process and requires private key generation
**When** the Key Protection Service generates a new key pair
**Then** the private key is securely stored in inaccessible hardware
And it is made accessible only by the user with the correct authorization

### Scenario: Retrieving a private key for signing content
**Given** a user wants to sign their content before broadcasting
**When** they request access to their private key
**Then** the Key Protection Service verifies their identity using multi-factor authentication
And it allows temporary, secure access to the private key for content signing

### Scenario: Revoking access to a compromised private key
**Given** a user reports their private key as compromised or stolen
**When** the Key Protection Service receives the report
**Then** it immediately revokes access to the compromised private key
And it generates a new key pair for the user after re-validating their identity

### Scenario: Periodic validation of private key integrity
**Given** the Key Protection Service performs routine security checks
**When** a scheduled integrity check occurs
**Then** the service assesses each stored private key for potential breaches or weaknesses
And if a vulnerability is discovered, the affected users are notified to re-secure their keys

### Scenario: Authorizing a company executive to sign official communications
**Given** a company executive is tasked with signing formal social media announcements
**When** they initiate the signature process for a new communication
**Then** the Key Protection Service verifies their authority against internal authorization lists
And if validated, it provides access to the executive's private key for signing the announcement
