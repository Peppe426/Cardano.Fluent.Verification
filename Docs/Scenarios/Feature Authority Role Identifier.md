## Feature: Authority Role Identifier

These scenarios outline various interactions involving the Authority Role Identifier, such as assigning and verifying permissions for signature keys based on organizational roles, blocking unauthorized communication attempts, updating permissions due to role changes, and auditing for compliance. The actors involved span organizational roles and security services, with the Authority Role Identifier playing a central role in maintaining the integrity of signed communications within the organization.

### Scenario: Assigning signing keys based on organizational roles
**Given** an organization has multiple roles that require different signing authorities
**When** each role is assigned a specific cryptographic key by the company's admin
**Then** the Authority Role Identifier associates these keys with their respective roles
And ensures that only individuals in these roles can use the keys to sign official communications

### Scenario: Verifying the signer's authority on a published communication
**Given** a communication is published by the organization and claims to be signed by the CEO
**When** the Signature Validator verifies the signature against the public key in the database
**Then** the Authority Role Identifier confirms whether the key is assigned to the CEO's role
And if confirmed, the communication is marked as verified
Otherwise, it is flagged for further investigation

### Scenario: Reacting to an unauthorized communication attempt
**Given** an individual within the organization attempts to sign a communication with a key not associated with their role
**When** the Key Protection Service detects the key usage
**Then** the Authority Role Identifier cross-checks the role against the key used for signing
And if the role and key mismatch, the communication is blocked and a security alert is issued

### Scenario: Updating signing authorities upon role changes
**Given** an individual is promoted to a new role within the organization
**When** their role change is processed by HR
**Then** the Authority Role Identifier updates the key association to reflect the new role
And ensures the previous role's key access is revoked and new key access is granted accordingly

### Scenario: Auditing key usage based on roles for compliance
**Given** the organization requires an audit of key usage for compliance reasons
**When** the audit request is initiated
**Then** the Authority Role Identifier provides a log of key usage associated with organizational roles
And it highlights any discrepancies or unauthorized attempts detected
