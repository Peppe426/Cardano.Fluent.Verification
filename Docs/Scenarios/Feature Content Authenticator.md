## Feature: Content Authenticator
These scenarios demonstrate the functionalities of the Content Authenticator in verifying content, confirming its authenticity, ensuring the integrity of distributed content, mitigating the spread of misinformation, and offering verification services for important communications. The actors include content creators, general users, and platform verification systems responsible for maintaining content trustworthiness.

### Scenario: Verifying original content creation
**Given** a content creator uploads a new piece of content to the platform
**When** the Content Authenticator receives the upload request
**Then** it links the content to the creator's verified DID
And it generates a cryptographic proof of the content's origin
Ensuring the content is traceable to the verified identity of the creator

### Scenario: Content authenticity confirmation for general users
**Given** a user views a piece of content on the platform
**When** they query the origin of the content
**Then** the Content Authenticator provides the verification details
Including the cryptographic proof linking the content to a verified DID
Allowing the user to trust the authenticity of the content

### Scenario: Automated integrity check for content distribution
**Given** content is shared or retweeted across the platform
**When** the integrity of the content needs to be preserved
**Then** the Content Authenticator automatically verifies the content against the original DID
And flags any altered or manipulated versions of the content as unverified

### Scenario: Mitigating the spread of fake news with verified authorship
**Given** misinformation is reported on the platform
**When** a review is initiated to verify the accuracy of the content
**Then** the Content Authenticator examines the connection between the content and the claimed DID
And if a mismatch is found, appropriate action is taken to reduce the visibility and spread of the fake content

### Scenario: Providing verification as a service for high-profile communications
**Given** an announcement from a high-profile individual or organization needs verification
**When** a request for authenticity check is submitted to the platform
**Then** the Content Authenticator correlates the announcement to the respective DID
And provides an authentication badge or marker affirming that the communication is from a credible source
