## Feature: Access Control Programmer
These scenarios showcase a user-centric perspective, allowing individuals to configure and personalize their account security, integrate hardware for authentication, manage cryptographic credentials, and set specific access permissions, all facilitated by the Access Control Programmer. The actors in these scenarios include users, hardware devices (such as tokens), cryptographic keys, and system administrators focused on compliance and security.

### Scenario: User customizing their access control settings
  **Given** a user is concerned about securing their account
  **When** the user accesses the Access Control Programmer feature
  **Then** they define their personalized access control settings
  And they enable two-factor authentication for enhanced security

### Scenario: Integrating a hardware device for user authentication
  **Given** a user wishes to use a hardware token for accessing their account
  **When** they integrate the token using the Access Control Programmer
  **Then** the system recognizes the hardware device as part of the user's authentication process
  And allows the user to use the token for secure logins

### Scenario: Adding a cryptographic credential to a user's profile
  **Given** a user needs to encrypt their communication for privacy
  **When** they utilize the Access Control Programmer to add a PGP key to their profile
  **Then** the system stores the cryptographic credential securely
  And uses it to verify and encrypt the user's communications

### Scenario: User configuring fine-grained access permissions
  **Given** a user requires different levels of access for various company systems
  **When** they specify conditional access rules via the Access Control Programmer
  **Then** the system enforces these rules
  Providing the user with custom and secure access based on the defined constraints

### Scenario: Administrative bulk-update of access controls for compliance
  **Given** a system administrator needs to implement new compliance measures
  **When** they use the Access Control Programmer to update access controls for all users
  **Then** the system applies the updates across the user base
  Ensuring organizational compliance with the new security protocols
