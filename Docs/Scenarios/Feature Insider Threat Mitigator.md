## Feature: Insider Threat Mitigator
These scenarios cover different aspects of the Insider Threat Mitigator's functionalities, such as monitoring unauthorized access attempts, enforcing security protocols, updating access control, and maintaining audit trails. The actors involved include system administrators, privileged and non-privileged employees, and the Insider Threat Mitigator system itself.

### Scenario: Detecting unauthorized access by an employee
**Given** a privileged user attempts to access a sensitive system outside their authorization
**When** the Insider Threat Mitigator detects the unauthorized access attempt
**Then** it immediately alerts the system administrators
And it temporarily suspends the user's access privileges pending an investigation

### Scenario: Preventing data exfiltration by a departing employee
**Given** a departing employee attempts to download sensitive data en masse
**When** the action triggers the Insider Threat Mitigator's anomaly detection
**Then** the system blocks the data transfer
And it alerts the security team to assess the potential data breach

### Scenario: Reinforcing multi-factor authentication for system access
**Given** a user is required to follow strict access protocols to enter a secure system
**When** they provide single-factor authentication instead of the required multi-factor authentication
**Then** the Insider Threat Mitigator denies access
And it logs the incident and notifies the user of the required authentication process

### Scenario: Enforcing access policies after a role change
**Given** an employee's role within the organization changes
**When** the employee's previous access permissions are no longer valid for their new role
**Then** the Insider Threat Mitigator updates the user's access rights in line with the new role
And monitors for any attempts to use old permissions

### Scenario: Auditing insider actions via secure audit trails
**Given** an organization requires transparency over sensitive data handling
**When** an insider takes action on a protected system
**Then** the Insider Threat Mitigator logs the action in a secure, immutable audit trail
And ensures the organization has a record to review for compliance and anomaly detection
