## Feature: Social Media Identity Registrar (SMIR)
These scenarios cover various aspects of the SMIR feature, from user registration and post authentication to access control management and handling of security incidents. The actors include the Social Media Identity Registrar, the Broadcast Authenticator, the Signature Validator, the Key Protection Service, and the Authority Role Identifier.

### Scenario: Registering a new user on the platform
  **Given** a new user wants to join the social media platform
  **When** the user submits a request for a decentralized identifier (DID)
  **Then** the Social Media Identity Registrar (SMIR) creates a unique DID
  And registers the DID for the user ensuring it corresponds to a real identity
  And the user is granted access to manage their credentials via SMIR interfaces

### Scenario: Authenticating a post by a user
  **Given** a user with a registered DID wants to post content
  **When** the user generates a post
  **Then**  the Broadcast Authenticator signs the post with a cryptographic key corresponding to the user's DID
  And the Signature Validator verifies the signature to confirm its authenticity
  If the signature is valid, the post is verified and broadcasted
  Otherwise, the post is flagged as unverified

### Scenario: Updating access control for a user's DID
  **Given** an existing user with a registered DID on the social media platform
  **When** the user decides to update their access control settings
  **Then**  SMIR provides interfaces for the identity owner to manage changes
  And enforces the updated policies and rules for the user's actions on the platform

### Scenario: Responding to a compromised key incident
  **Given** a user reports a compromised private key used for signing content
  **When** the Key Protection Service receives the report
  **Then**  the compromised key is invalidated and removed from the system
  And a new private key is created, stored securely, and assigned to the user's DID

### Scenario: Verifying the authority to sign official communications
  **Given** a post is broadcasted as an official communication
  **When** the Signature Validator checks the authenticity of the signature
  **Then**  the Authority Role Identifier confirms the role of the individual who signed the post
  And if the individual has proper authorization, the communication is validated
  Otherwise, the post is flagged as unauthorized
