I want you to help me come up with scenarios for my feature "Content Authenticatorr", use the gherkin syntax, make sure the actors are included





Diagram description for later use:

At the center, place Identity Owners, depicted as individuals with their Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).

Branching off from the Identity Owners, display Social Media Identity Registrars (SMIRs) as a service point connecting Identity Owners with a central registry.

Above the Identity Owners, show Broadcast Authenticators as a part of the social media platform infrastructure, indicating their role in signing and authenticating posts.

On the client side, represent Signature Validators as a security guard symbol, checking each post against known public keys, possibly linked to a public key infrastructure (PKI) database symbol.

Next to the Broadcast Authenticators, illustrate Key Protection Services as safes or key icons, providing secure storage and access control for private keys.

Across from the Social Media Identity Registrars, depict Blockchain DID Registrars showing the recording of DIDs on a blockchain, with chains linking each DID entry symbolizing the blockchain ledger.

Around the perimeter or within organizational boundaries, place Authority Role Identifiers assigning keys to specific roles within an organization, displaying keys with role labels.

Near the Key Protection Services, incorporate Insider Threat Mitigators as a security shield, monitoring internal access and acting as a safeguard.

For each actor with external interactions (like the SMIR and Broadcast Authenticators), add communication lines to show the flow of information and trust, such as arrows signifying the creation, signature, and validation of posts.

Finally, emphasize the role of Content Authenticators for companies like Twitter, linking them to the Identity Owners and the Broadcast Authenticators, showing a continuous loop of verification from the user to the post and the audience.
